## HyperVerse

HyperVerse is the extended reality crafted by the HyperCube platform. It represents the conclusion of everything that is now being developed in the fields of AR and VR. HyperVerse is a one-to-one map with an almost inconceivable level of detail. The physical world will be seamlessly integrated with the digital universe by the introduction of HyperVerse.

### Use Cases of HyperVerse

Consider the following scenario: you're strolling along the street. Suddenly, you come up with an idea for a product you need. A vending machine emerges immediately next to you, stocked with the product and variants you were considering. Then you pull over, choose an item from a vending machine, have it delivered to your home, and continue on your way.

After that, visualize a husband and wife. The husband offers to take the wife to the shop, but she is unable to recall the product's name or the kind of goods she need. When she walks inside the shop, her brain-computer interface gadget identifies it and sends a connection to her husband's device, as well as the names of the stores and aisles where it is situated.

### Origin of HyperVerse

HyperVerse is the HyperCube's Vision and Implementation of Metaverse. Metaverse is an alternative digital worlds exist where individuals work, play, and interact with one another. 

According to Wikipedia, Metaverse is a collective virtual shared place that is produced by the convergence of virtually improved physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, which includes the total of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the Internet, among other things. The term "metaverse" is a portmanteau of the prefix "meta" (meaning beyond) and the word "universe." It is typically used to describe the concept of a future iteration of the internet that is made up of persistent, shared, 3D virtual spaces that are linked together to form a perceived virtual universe; the term "metaverse" is a portmanteau of the words "meta" (meaning beyond) and "universe."

### Challenges of HyperVerse

The metaverse is a shared virtual environment in which individuals are represented by computer-generated characters known as avatars (think Ready Player One). 

People are yet to be able to join the metaverse fully virtually (i.e., via virtual reality) or interact with portions of it in their physical environment through the use of augmented and mixed reality technologies.Users can now only experience the internet when you physically travel to it. 

New connections, gadgets, and technologies are needed, like Decentralized Identifiers, Digital Twin of Fiat, 5G connection, etc.

### Outlook of HyperVerse

For marketing and communications, the metaverse is the next frontier in online engagement.

While we do not yet have a single common metaverse, there are businesses positioning themselves to work on establishing one in the near future.

Fortnite, Minecraft, and Animal Crossing are all now available as games, but they already have large user bases, complex environments, and a plethora of user-generated material. The virtual reality social media platform Horizon (which is presently in development) and Facebook Live Maps are both examples of how the social media giant is positioning itself towards the metaverse. Niantic, Magic Leap, Microsoft, and a slew of other companies are all working on it.

The epidemic has also had an impact on online culture. Organizing family reunions on Zoom, having marriages in Animal Crossing, having graduations in Minecraft, and digitally putting on clothing have all become popular activities. With online social gatherings growing more popular and online video games expanding their world-building capabilities, "it's inevitable that brands will play a major role in the metaverse," according to the authors.
