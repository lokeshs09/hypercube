# Storage

HyperCube has proposed a series of decentralized on-chain storage protocols and infrastructure to help HyperCube developers develop blockchain applications quickly and at low cost.

## Agamenon Protocol

AGAMENON is a powerful new protocol for storing data perpetually, immutably, and securely on a decentralized permanent network. AGAMENON's economic model, which is similar to proof of work in concept, allows for permanent data preservation. This strategy effectively establishes an "endowment" for each stored piece of information, rewarding those with the longest storage and recall times. As a result, payment for data storage on AGAMENON is a one-time transaction with no recurring costs, fees, or technological maintenance, resulting in data storage that is permanent.

It should be mentioned that AGAMENON is not pricey; however, short-term data storage is more expensive â€” this is since data stored on AGAMENON is permanent. The HyperCube network's ledger conversion data and indexes will be totally kept on AGAMENON, and future development work will support richer indexes.

## Blockc Thread 

This new concept was built exclusively for the AGAMENON protocol. Similar to a block chain, which is a collection of connected blocks containing transactions, a block thread is a sequence of blocks that contain data and are linked to numerous prior blocks in the network. The network can use this data structure to compel miners to submit "Proof of Dedication" (PoD) for existing data before adding new blocks.

## EVERNET Perpetual Network

EVERNET sits on top of the core AGAMENO data storage layer. EVERNET is a collection of interrelated documents and applications, similar to a regular network, except that all content is kept forever. The browser can access all data stored in the EVERNET network because it is based on HTTP (a protocol derived from the regular Web). Since the EVERNET network has nothing to do with content, EVERNET can be used to access various materials, including wikis, PDFs, movies, and web applications. 

Once these files are added to the EVERNET network, they can be continuously accessed from anywhere in the world anytime, anywhere. In addition, after uploading, no one (including the original uploader) can change them in any way, thus ensuring the integrity of the application and the verifiability of the documents by consumers.
