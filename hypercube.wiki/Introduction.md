# HyperCube Public Blockchain 
## HyperCube Overview

HyperCube was established in August 2017 to build a better blockchain and intelligent trading platform. The HyperCube network is being built to enhance global banking and payment systems. HyperCube is the first digital currency designed for enterprises. Since Bitcoin, HyperCube is the first novel Satoshi Nakamoto consensus method that includes BFT. It was developed by researchers in HyperCube Labs and is called the Proof of Dedication. The team includes top engineers from Google, Netfliex and Amazon, as well as distinguished scholars from Stanford University, Cambridge University and Oxford University, as well as IEEE standard setters. XZP Virtual and the new intelligent transaction programming language XRexx from HyperCube are powerful, auditable and secure. Atomic swaps, authorized payees, recoverable wallets, multi-signature wallets, and rate-limited wallets are examples of smart transactions that are currently accessible.

## Positioning of HyperCube?

In the second half of 2021, POW mining public chains such as BTC and ETH will enter a new round of bull market. At that time, PoW and other conceptual sectors will have new attention and hot spots. At the same time, the characteristics of slow PoW and high gas fees will also be prominently displayed. The new HyperCube public chain will launch a new PoD mining formula algorithm. The POD algorithm is based on HyperCube’s self-developed network dynamic equilibrium formula, combined with the BFT algorithm, to locate network records in multiple dimensions from energy, time, online time, and community investment. Account privileges can obtain higher network security than ETHash (the consensus algorithm of cryptocurrency on Ethereum) while maintaining high speed. The HyperCube public chain is a two-layer expansion solution compatible with Ethereum, which can expand the landing of Ethereum. With the existing powerful ecology of Ethereum, HyperCube will become a powerful part of Ethereum in the future, challenging Ethereum's current dominant position in the smart contract platform. .

HyperCube was born for financial and social applications. HyperCube is a set of officially launched Ethereum layer 2 expansion solutions. It is a side chain network that applies the PoD consensus protocol, allowing highly scalable games and user-oriented DApps to run on top of it, while still being affected by Ethereum. The security support of the workshop.

## What is XPZ?

XPZ is the native token of HyperCube. The total amount of XPZ is 2.1 billion.

## How HyperCube makes money

HyperCube positions itself as a free and open source platform where anyone can access its products, including technologies, products and services.

## Compared with other public chains, what are the advantages of HyperCube (XPZ) public chain?

Since we first introduced the basic concept of HyperCube in 2017, the core team at HyperCube Lab has been working on finding a solution to have a decentralized node network function on par with a single node for the past four years. This is a characteristic that no other major blockchain is capable of matching. The achievement of this aim is the ultimate goal of HyperCube.

Since its inception, the HyperCube team, which is comprised of pioneering technical experts from organizations such as the IEEE, Amazon, Netflix, Intel, Netscape, and Google, has been concentrating on the technology required to build HyperCube in order to meet these ground-breaking performance specifications.

The transaction processing speed of proof-of-work-based systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum is approximately ten times faster than that of traditional systems (TPS). Tendermint and other practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)-based Proof of Stake (PoS) systems support 1,000 TPS for 100–200 nodes, and other PBFT-based systems support 2,000 TPS for 100–200 nodes. With more than 50,000 transactions per second (TPS) and more than 100 nodes in its current testnet iteration, the PBFT-like proof-of-work blockchain HyperCube is the world's fastest blockchain and the world's first network-scale decentralized network.


## Partners of HyperCube

As a result, the team independently developed the world's first cross-chain traceability and anti-counterfeiting system based on blockchain technology with a multi-industry and multi-chain architecture, and is committed to creating information transparency, collaboration efficiency, and value using the blockchain trusted network architecture. High-speed transmission of multi-chain traceability value information ecological environment. The project team comes from industry elites in many regions of the world. After long-term efforts, the current basic application model has achieved the standards for urban landing applications.

HyperCube is the product of industry-university-research cooperation. The HyperCube team has established a solid cooperative relationship with well-known investment institutions such as Oxford University, Cambridge University, Imperial College, IEEE, Grayscale Investment, Coinbase Investment, Rothschild Family Fund, Pantera Investment, Ark Investment, etc.


### University of Cambridge

The University of Cambridge was founded in 1209 and is located in Cambridge, England. It is one of the top universities in the UK and in the world. Many famous British scientists, writers, and politicians come from this university. Cambridge University is also the institution of higher learning with the largest number of Nobel Prize winners. About 80 Nobel Prize winners have taught or studied here, and more than 70 are students of Cambridge University. The University of Cambridge is also a member of the "Russell Group", an alliance of prestigious universities in the United Kingdom, a member of the Coimbra Group, an alliance of universities in Europe, and one of the British Golden Triangle Universities. The University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford are the two best universities in the UK, collectively known as "Oxbridge", and are one of the top ten universities in the world.


### Oxford university

Oxford University in the United Kingdom has a worldwide reputation. It has an extremely important position in the British society and higher education system and has a worldwide influence.
