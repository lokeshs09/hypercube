# DeFi on HyperCube

## Overview

HyperCube provides a solid support for DeFi Development.Additionally, as part of the HyperCube project, we've developed a new on-chain programming environment called XRexx, which is every bit as powerful as Solidity while also being much more auditable and scalable. Additionally, it promotes significantly improved software development methods.

As an illustration of the strength of on-chain programming in HyperCube, and how it varies from Solidity, this section will provide a summary of how it allows fully decentralized exchange while providing substantial protections against miner/farmer extracted value in this article (MEV). In addition, discussion on the advantages of using automated market makers (AMMs) in HyperCube trading will also be given.
