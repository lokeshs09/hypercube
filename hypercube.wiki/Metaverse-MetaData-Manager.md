# MetaData Manager

Because NFTs are autonomous entities on the blockchain, they enable the administration of overarching information that may be utilized and modified by a variety of decentralized applications (dApps).

This will make it possible for projects to interconnect utilities such that they may benefit from one another, such as: Use your NFT to complete job A in dApp A in order to get access to benefit B in dApp B.

Another use case would be an NFT-based game avatar that can level up across various games by improving several sets of game metrics, which would be more specialized.

Custom properties may be added to an NFT blueprint.

MetaPlant offers an infrastructure via an API / SDK to maintain statistics related to unique NFT-Utility pairs in order to facilitate the management of NFT-related information. Because of this, each dApp may keep its own datasets without interfering with the operations of other pairs that refer to the same network file system.
Third-party data, on the other hand, may be inherited in order to provide genuine cross-use experiences if needed.
Management and distribution of tokens
Using the MetaPlant project dashboard, you can either generate new NFT blueprints on the HyperCube smart contract or import old blueprints from a previous version.

To transmit batches of various tokens and amounts at the same time, create token orders and use fine-grained distribution parameters to do so.
In addition, the platform has a comprehensive distribution module that allows for fine-grained control over distribution methods, monitoring distribution progress, and recording expenditures for accounting and reporting reasons.
