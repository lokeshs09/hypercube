# DApp Link

Projects may use MetaPlant to build, examine, and link NFT Blueprints and Utilities across a variety of dApps.

Those who create NFTs (such as decentralized applications (dApps), businesses (such as brands), artists (such as content creators), streamers (such as celebrities), and others can use the platform to integrate third-party utility into their tokens, allowing their holders to benefit from additional use-cases.

Similarly, utility providers (e.g., video games, services, platforms, events, and online shops) may provide utilities for particular NFT blueprints in order to benefit and attract the holders of these blueprints.

These connections are established as a result of cooperation requests made between projects in order to create a new link within an ever-expanding network of assets.

Request for collaboration between two projects in order to connect an NFT to a utility
The scope of the collaboration may be tailored by adding restrictions and quotas to the cooperation request when it is sent in order to connect with a specific asset.
This enables for the creation of limitless or temporary utilities that may be either consumable (e.g., vouchers, mana, event tickets, coupons) or non-consumable (e.g., coupons, event tickets, coupons) (e.g., memberships, virtual characters).

Holders of NFTs will be informed when a link has been made and will be given access to the newly created utility once it has been established.
