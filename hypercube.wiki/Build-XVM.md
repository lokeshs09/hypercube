# XVM Virtual Machine

HyperCube Chain adds value to the ecosystem by allowing developers to create their own distributed apps using a wide range of tools. As illustrated in the diagram below, the HyperCube chain includes a Rexx-based programming language XRexx and a matching virtual machine XVM. Developers on the HyperCube Chain use programming languages to convert business logic into smart contracts, which are then converted into bytecodes that machines may run using virtual machines.
