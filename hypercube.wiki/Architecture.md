## HyperCube Sphere

With an octa-core technology at its core, the HyperCube blockchain is both highly scalable and safe, as well as completely decentralized

HyperCube is a hybrid power-of-stake blockchain, which means that it relies on users to stake their XPZ tokens in order to become a certified miner on the network. Miners are paid to look through and verify transactions, and they do it in exchange for payments. When participating in a HyperPool, one alpha node is in charge of creating ledger entries; the likelihood of obtaining this job grows the more XPZ tokens a miner stakes.
Any particular miner node should never be the alpha node for an extended period of time; instead, an alpha node schedule limits each designated miner to 1 block until the next alpha node takes up the position.
